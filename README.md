Worked independently and with groups on multiple projects to build experience:
Built multiple websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating APIs to improve accessibility and display dynamic data.
Used React in a group project and am currently building a personal React site to explore the framework further and showcase my 3D printing projects.
Wrote Python and R code for data analysis on topics like crime, loans, and student performance—often involving data cleaning and wrangling.
Created SQL queries and subqueries to pull and manipulate data from academic databases.
Developed classes and methods for larger Java projects with GUI components, including a restaurant simulation where inventory, menu items, sales, and profits had to interact in a full system.

<p>
  In the langauge distribution, the jupyter notebook percentage is all imported from google colab and in python.<br>
  Because the notebooks include python code, regular text like introductions and analysis, and data outputs they APPEAR to be a lot more of the percentage than they should really account for
