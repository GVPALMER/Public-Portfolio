# Public-Portfolio

### This portfolio is a combination of personal and educational projects that I've compiled. Some are from 2021 and some are more recent (2025). They display varying different skill levels and a variety of skills.


<p>
  In the langauge distribution, the jupyter notebook percentage is all imported from google colab and in python.<br>
  Because the notebooks include python code, regular text like introductions and analysis, and data outputs they APPEAR to be a lot more of the percentage than they should really account for.

<ul>
